# 🎧 Audio Deepfake Detection Metrics

This repository provides a complete evaluation toolkit for **Audio Deepfake Detection** and **Speaker Verification** systems. It implements key evaluation metrics such as:

- ✅ Equal Error Rate (EER)
- ✅ Detection Cost Function (DCF)
- ✅ Tandem Detection Cost Function (t-DCF)  
  *(including constrained and unconstrained methods)*

The code is inspired by ASVspoof challenges and relevant academic literature in spoofing countermeasures and speaker verification evaluation.

## 📦 Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn matplotlib torch
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python evaluation_measures.py
```

This will:
- Generate synthetic ASV and CM scores
- Compute evaluation metrics
- Print them to the console
- Plot t-DCF curves for visual analysis

## 🧠 Evaluation Theory

This repo implements metric computations based on the following concepts:

- **EER**: The point where false acceptance and false rejection rates are equal.
- **DCF**: Cost-based metric combining false accept/reject rates with task-specific costs.
- **t-DCF**: Measures the impact of a spoofing countermeasure (CM) in a tandem ASV+CM system, incorporating priors and detection costs.
